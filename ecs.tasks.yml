# @NOTE removing a task from this config won't delete it, you need to put the state as "delete" and run the task script again.
#
# these are merged with each task, add key:value to a specific task if you want to change.
# a tasks.environment value is used to also map to the global configuration here:
# @param environment_vars adds global env vars to the task, they can be overridden by defining it in the task.
# defining a "task_definition" will modify behavior and use that specific arn instead of getting the latest.
